Here’s how to **sell yourself effectively** in your Tram Case interview — focusing on your strongest, most relevant traits for this specific role (Tech Lead / Principal Engineer in AI Legal Tech):

---

### 1. **Lead with Mission Fit**

**Why it matters:** Tram Case is mission-driven — they want engineers who care about impact.
**How to frame it:**

> “What drew me most to Tram Case is the mission — using AI to make legal services faster and more accessible. I’ve spent my career building systems that simplify complex processes, so this is exactly the kind of problem I care about solving.”

Show that you understand **why** this matters: efficiency in law = more people helped.

### 2. **Position Yourself as a Systems Architect with Startup Grit**

**Why it matters:** They’re rebuilding the OS for law firms — they need people who can design end-to-end systems.
**How to frame it:**

> “I’ve led architecture for distributed, mission-critical systems — from API design and database scaling to frontend experience. I’m comfortable owning full-stack decisions, from backend performance tuning to product UX.”

Highlight your track record in **high-impact, small-team environments** — “I ship fast but design for scale.”

### 3. **Demonstrate AI Fluency and Practical Application**

**Why it matters:** They’re heavy on LLMs, RAG, and agent workflows.
**How to frame it:**

> “I’ve integrated LLMs into production systems — retrieval pipelines, agent orchestration, and human-in-the-loop validation. I focus on building trustworthy AI that augments human decision-making, not replaces it.”

Keep it tangible — talk about **actual pipelines, model integration, or performance optimization** you’ve done.

### 4. **Show Leadership and Ownership**

**Why it matters:** Their culture values “Directly Responsible Individuals.”
**How to frame it:**

> “I naturally take ownership end-to-end — identifying problems, shipping solutions, and iterating with users. I’m comfortable making decisions with incomplete data and holding the technical bar high for the team.”

You can mention mentoring or unblocking others, but keep it outcome-oriented.

---

### 5. **Speak in Terms of Impact, Not Just Tech**

Frame everything as **value delivered** — faster systems, more reliable pipelines, improved developer velocity.

> “I don’t just build features — I design systems that let teams move faster and deliver more value per engineer.”

---

### 6. **End with Vision and Calm Confidence**

Tram Case’s tone is thoughtful and mission-driven. Close with something like:

> “I’m excited by the idea of bringing order and clarity to complex systems — whether that’s codebases or legal workflows. I want to help build the foundation that lets AI genuinely serve people.”
